## As part of a captone project during my time at DePaul, we developed a self-adjusting Fraud Detection System (FDS). The three main problems we focused on in this project are concept drift, class imbalance, and performance measurement. Please see uploaded deck and report going into complete background and analysis on the methods deployed.

### <u>Below are the steps to successfully running the code from our project. </u>


Step 1: Please install any packages you do not have from the requirements document.

Step 2: If you would like to choose your own optimal model you can run the model exploration.pynb and observe the output to choose which model you would like to use

Step 3: the simulation is all codded in the Capstone Monte Carlo Simulation-extra-drift.ipynb file and has all the necessary code to run and save the results of the simulation to which ever directory it is ran from. 

Step 4: To run the simulation simply open the Capstone Monte Carlo Simulation-extra-drift.ipynb and run all. This code will take a very long time to run and at the end it will save many csv files. The file with all the results combines is the alll_vals-10-31-2023-extra-drift.csv file. This file will be used to visualize the results

Step 5: to visualize the results run the Results_Vizualizations.ipynb file make sure you have the csv file alll_vals-10-31-2023-extra-drift.csv (results from the simulation) in the same directory

Environment used

-	Anaconda and jupyter notebooks where used to process the code
-	Data Files included: raw.csv (base data used only in model exploration and partially in the simulation)
